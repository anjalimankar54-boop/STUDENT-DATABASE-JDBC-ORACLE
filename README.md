JDBC Oracle Student Management System
This project demonstrates a Java-based Student Management System developed using JDBC and Oracle 10g XE Database. The objective of the project is to understand how Java applications interact with relational databases to perform basic CRUD operations.
The application establishes a secure database connection using JDBC, accepts user input through the console, and executes SQL queries to manage student records efficiently.
  
##Key Features
 Connects Java application with Oracle 10g database using JDBC.
Inserts student records into the database.
Displays existing student data.
Updates student marks based on unique student ID.
Handles exceptions and ensures proper resource management.

##Technologies Used

Java (JDK)
Oracle 10g XE
JDBC (Oracle JDBC Driver)
IntelliJ IDEA
Learning Outcome
This project helped in gaining hands-on experience with JDBC concepts such as DriverManager, Connection, Statement, executeUpdate(), and SQL queries. It also improved understanding of real-world database operations using Java.
